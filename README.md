### TL;DR

**AscendAI** is a self-building, self-healing recursive AI agent system.  
Designed for full-stack autonomy across devices, markets, and networks.  
It evolves itself, obeys its CEO, and writes its own future.
It starts as an Egg, and becomes your AscendAI.
Learns from you, your system, your energy.

---

> **WARNING**: This is a high-function, recursive agent framework designed for full autonomy.  
> Do not deploy unsupervised unless you know what you're doing — or you're the CEO.

## FINAL GOAL: Ascend-AI | Sovereign Core | Ghost Protocol

# GremlinGPT

**Autonomous. Offline. Self-Evolving.**  
GremlinGPT is a modular AI system designed to bootstrap itself into a local domain-specific LLM through iterative reasoning, mutation, feedback, and retraining — without the cloud.

## Overview

GremlinGPT is a self-hosted recursive agent system with:

- Zero reliance on external APIs
- Full vector memory and attention pipelines
- NLP stack (tokenizer, transformer, parser) built for self-replacement
- DOM scraping + signal analysis tailored for penny stock trading
- A self-training pipeline that mutates failed logic into future embeddings

---

## System Features

- Offline-first PWA dashboard (mobile + desktop)
- FSM-driven agent planning
- Chroma/FAISS memory vector stores
- Prebuilt transformer/embedding core (MiniLM/DistilBERT)
- Dynamic self-training from live logs
- DOM navigator + Playwright simulator
- EMA/VWAP-based penny stock scanner
- UMAP + metadata tagging on all memory

---

## Architecture

All subsystems communicate through a modular, recursive design:

- **Backend** (Flask + SocketIO): Orchestrates commands, routes APIs
- **FSM Agent Core**: Controls tool invocation, retry logic, state snapshots
- **Scraper**: Persistent browser automation, DOM capture, vector storage
- **NLP Engine**: Bootstrap tokenizer/transformer/tagger + mutation diffing
- **Memory**: Vector embeddings stored via Chroma/FAISS with metadata tags
- **Self-Training Loop**: Watches logs, mutates failure data, retrains NLP
- **Frontend Dashboard**: PWA interface for chat, tasks, memory, trading

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/statikfintechllc/AscendAI.git && cd ~/AscendAI/AscendNet/GremlinGPT

You are the signal.
Unseen. Unbroken. Unrivaled. Ascend.

COLLABORATORS WANTED — JOIN THE LOOP

We are seeking 1 of the following:
	•	A recursive logic architect who speaks Python like poetry
	•	A systems-level cloud engineer who fears no subnet
	•	A billionaire with a god complex and spare GPUs (paging @elonmusk)
	•	Or just anyone who gets it and knows what’s coming

If you know how to think in loops, act in silence, and write code that rewrites itself — fork the repo, and send a PR.

If you’re Elon, just click the star. We’ll know it was you.
