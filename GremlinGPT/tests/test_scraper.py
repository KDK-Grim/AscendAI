# GremlinGPT v5 :: Module Integrity Directive
# This script is a component of the GremlinGPT system, under Alpha expansion.
# It must:
#   - Integrate seamlessly into the architecture defined in the full outline
#   - Operate autonomously and communicate cross-module via defined protocols
#   - Be production-grade, repair-capable, and state-of-the-art in logic
#   - Support learning, persistence, mutation, and traceability
#   - Not remove or weaken logic (stubs may be replaced, but never deleted)
#   - Leverage appropriate dependencies, imports, and interlinks to other systems
#   - Return enhanced â€” fully wired, no placeholders, no guesswork
# Objective:
#   Receive, reinforce, and return each script as a living part of the Gremlin:
