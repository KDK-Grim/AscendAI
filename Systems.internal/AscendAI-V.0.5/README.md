# AscendNet: Sovereign Bootstrap System

> “Devin is the beginning. Ascend is the evolution.”

**AscendNet** is the infrastructural boot system for initializing Ascend’s recursive agents and AI layers. It includes:

- Devin (the primal autonomous agent)
- Vector memory embedding and search
- Task queue logic
- ChatGPT desktop interface
- Multi-agent system preparation
- Hardware-level readiness protocols

---

## Integration with Ascend

AscendNet is **invoked during system install and boot**, and:
- Sets up the Conda environment
- Launches `Devin` via `Neo.sh`
- Routes persistent memory and scripts into the main loop engine
- Prepares agents for recursive self-modification

Do not clone or use this as a separate repo. It is a component of the [AscendAI Framework](https://github.com/statikfintechllc/AscendAI).
