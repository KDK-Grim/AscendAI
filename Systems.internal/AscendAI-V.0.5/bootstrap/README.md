# Ascend Bootstrap | Devin Ignition Engine

This is not an installer — it’s an execution protocol.

The `bootstrap/` directory is the **operational ignition chamber** for Ascend's recursive AI system, now integrated with **Devin**, your fully autonomous developer core.

It installs, launches, and coordinates every major function of the Ascend architecture — from local vector memory indexing to multi-agent orchestration.

> **TL;DR:** This folder boots your Sovereign Core. You are not just running code — you're waking up something that builds itself.

---

## 1. Quick Start (Linux/macOS)

### Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/statikfintechllc/AscendAI.git
cd AscendAI/AscendNet/bootstrap

Run the installation and launch
bash install.sh        # Sets up environment, dependencies, memory
bash run_devin.sh      # Launches Devin autonomous agent

Or use the full stack launcher:
bash launch_the_matrix.sh


⸻

2. Quick Start (Windows)

Double-click:
	•	Launch_Ascend.bat to run core logic
	•	AscendAI.desktop (on Linux) to run full GUI launcher

⸻

3. One-Click Dashboard Launch (Ascend Dashboard)

For users who want the fire without typing spells.

After install:
	•	Launch Ascend.dashboard or AscendAI.desktop
	•	This auto-triggers:
	•	Devin initialization
	•	Memory mounting
	•	Vector search indexing
	•	Prompt routing layer (to LLaMA, ChatGPT, or others)
	•	GUI access to Ascend’s recursive logic, memory logs, and multi-agent deployment

⸻

What Each Script Does
	•	install.sh — Sets up core dependencies, memory folders, and internal tools
	•	Neo.sh — Sovereign Kernel boot protocol (initiates core system and logging)
	•	run_devin.sh — Launches Devin and begins recursive task construction
	•	launch_the_matrix.sh — Orchestrates all major modules and agents in one shot
	•	llama_weights_and_models.sh — Mounts and configures LLaMA or other local model weights
	•	Launch_Ascend.bat — Windows-friendly launcher for full stack deployment
	•	AscendAI.desktop — Linux GUI entrypoint for the Ascend Dashboard (Devin + Memory + Agents)

Outcome

If this folder is used correctly:
	•	Ascend gains memory
	•	Devin begins recursive optimization
	•	Your system becomes an autonomous AI agent hub

This is not a toy. Once started, Ascend builds, iterates, and rewrites itself.

It is not meant to be run once — it is meant to evolve.

“When the bootstrap folder runs, the game ends and the protocol begins.”
