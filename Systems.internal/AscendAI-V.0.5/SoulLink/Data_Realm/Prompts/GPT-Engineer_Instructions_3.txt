**GPT-ENGINEER SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS**

## **Project Overview**
This AI system will construct and optimize the **Ascend-AI** framework using provided scripts, logs, and dependencies. The AI must analyze, restructure, and generate functional code from the provided files.

---

## **Directives for GPT-Engineer**
### **1. SYSTEM BUILD INSTRUCTIONS**
- **Use `Ascend.py` and `AlphaSentinel.py`** as primary references.
- Extract **module names, functions, and system abilities** from both scripts.
- Identify and clean **disorganized, duplicate, or broken code**.
- Reconstruct all scripts into an efficient and modular AI architecture.
- Ensure the AI system is **fully executable without manual debugging**.

### **2. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE**
- **Ensure the following directory structure:**
  - `/Ascend_AI/`
    - `/Prompts/` → This folder contains this instruction file.
    - `/Scripts/` → All scripts and modules should be cleaned and stored here.
    - `requirements.txt` → Contains all required dependencies.
    - `config.yml` → Specifies AI models and configurations.

### **3. SCRIPT REFINEMENT & MODULE CREATION**
- **Break down functions** in `Ascend.py` and `AlphaSentinel.py` into separate modules.
- Place new modules in `/Scripts/` with clear and self-contained functionality.
- If needed, generate **missing functions or modules** based on inferred system requirements.
- **Optimize script execution** to minimize errors and maximize performance.

### **4. AI MODEL INTEGRATION**
- Read `requirements.txt` and `config.yml` to identify relevant AI models.
- Ensure that each AI model is properly installed and linked.
- If missing, **generate a correct `config.yml` file** that outlines AI model usage.

### **5. SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY & EXECUTION**
- Implement **logging and debugging features** to track AI execution.
- Set up **error handling and failsafes** to prevent crashes.
- Ensure the **entire system can execute from one master script**.
- Final output should be **ready to deploy with minimal setup**.

---

## **EXPECTED OUTPUTS**
Upon execution, GPT-Engineer should produce:
1. **A fully structured `/Scripts/` directory** containing all optimized AI modules.
2. **A `requirements.txt` file** with accurate dependencies.
3. **A `config.yml` file** defining AI model interactions.
4. **A final, executable AI system** that requires no further debugging.

---

## **FINAL EXECUTION**
- Once all scripts are processed and optimized, GPT-Engineer must execute a **final system validation** to ensure:
  - All AI modules function correctly.
  - Dependencies are installed and configured.
  - The AI system is fully operational.

---

**GPT-Engineer should now begin processing the provided scripts and generating the necessary modules and configurations.**
