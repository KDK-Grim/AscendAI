# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support the current and weirdly stable versions only. The rest are abandoned like buggy AI prototypes.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| latest  | ✅                 |
| dev     | 🌀 Use at your own risk |
| < stable | ❌                |

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you find something dangerous, broken, or exploitable:

- DM directly via Signal/Text: **+1 (785) 443-6288**
- Email the Ghost Ops Unit: **Ascend.Gremlin@gmail.com**
- Do **NOT** post vulnerabilities in public issues unless you want to start a war.

### What Happens Next?

- You’ll get a response within 72 hours.
- If it’s real, it gets patched.
- If it’s fire, you get props and possibly a digital rune etched in your name.
- If you’re trolling, you get ignored.

We reward useful intel. We block clout chasers.

Stay sharp.
