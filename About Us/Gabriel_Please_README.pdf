Hi Gabriel — quick clarification that matters.

What I sent wasn’t hype, but I may have framed it like GremlinGPT is already a fully autonomous system. I want to be clear and grounded in truth:
- It launches: scraper, memory vector store, FSM loop, NLP processor, and front-end shell
- Logs and daemons persist correctly across modules
- The recursive agent loop is architected but not yet executing real tasks
- Some internal glue and trigger logic is still in development

What I’ve built is a real skeleton — not a demo, not a hallucination. It runs local, offline, with zero cloud dependence. Every part is engineered to grow into itself.

It’s not finished. But it’s not nothing. And I’m not faking momentum.
I learn fast. I ship constantly. And I built this from zero — solo, no team, no backing.

I’m not looking for a handout. I’m looking for the right roof to finish what I started.
Thanks for seeing it. I meant everything I said.
