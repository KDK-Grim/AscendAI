LLaMA Integration Instructions for Fractal Echo AutoBot:

1. Extend Data Pipelines:
   - Load SPY, IWM, and penny stock data from Ascend’s shared memory or DB.
   - Use LLaMA's NLP to label fractal patterns based on candle behavior.

2. Embed AutoBot as a Module:
   - Wrap `run_autobot()` in a persistent background coroutine (async/await).
   - Bind results to Ascend's Dashboard output layer via socket/webhook.

3. Pattern Memory:
   - Store fractal matches in vector DB.
   - Train LLaMA to classify “early echo” vs “late stage fade”.

4. Automation Extensions:
   - Use `pyautogui` to control live charts/trade entries.
   - Trigger dashboard alerts or Discord posts using NLP-generated summaries.

5. Sync Webhooks:
   - Fractal Echo AutoBot posts to /alerts/fractals on your server
   - Discord/Slack/TradingView hooks can be layered on top

This AutoBot is a logic spine. Use LLaMA to give it a voice, memory, and execution reach.
