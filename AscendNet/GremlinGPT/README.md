# GremlinGPT (Ascend Subsystem)

**GremlinGPT** is a specialized, autonomous local agent module within the Ascend AI architecture.

It is designed to:
- Scrape websites and collect intel
- Execute trading logic inside containerized environments
- Run custom Python payloads inside Docker
- Analyze financial trends using TA indicators
- Refactor its own logic
- Send alert messages (with attitude) via Telegram

This is not a chatbot. This is an aggressive backroom analyst with a grudge and no sleep cycle.

## Role in Ascend

GremlinGPT serves as a subsystem under Ascend’s Sovereign Core. It supports:
- Task automation via `task_queue/`
- Market data processing
- Recursive behavioral refinement
- Local-first execution in decentralized deployments

This folder is **not intended to be cloned standalone** — it is activated via the main Ascend boot protocol (`./Neo.sh`).
