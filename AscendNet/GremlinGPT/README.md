# GremlinGPT

GremlinGPT is a local, autonomous AI system that:
- Scrapes websites
- Runs custom Python code inside Docker
- Makes and executes trading decisions
- Analyzes market trends with TA indicators
- Modifies its own tools and logic
- Screams at you on Telegram when it crashes

Itâ€™s like AutoGPT, if AutoGPT lived in your basement and made crypto trades while you were at work.
