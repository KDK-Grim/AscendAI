# GremlinGPT: Autonomous Recursive Intelligence System

**Author**: Statik Smoke  
**Core AI**: GremlinGPT  
**Version**: v1.0 Alpha  
**Install Path**: /home/statiksmoke8/AscendNet/GremlinGPT

---

## OVERVIEW

GremlinGPT is a **quantum-compatible, self-mutating, recursive AI framework** built to autonomously generate, execute, learn, and evolve its own systems using a modular architecture of AI agents, vector memory, LLMs, and quantum logic bridges.

It integrates:
- **LLMs**: StarCoder2, nanoGPT, Mistral (for autonomous code execution & adaptation)  
- **Agent Chains**: CrewAI + LangChain + AutoGPT logic (task orchestration)  
- **Memory**: ChromaDB + FAISS with LangChain semantic memory adapters  
- **Training**: PyTorch Lightning + Deepspeed + Flash Attention  
- **Quantum Mutation Layer**: Qiskit + PennyLane + quantum bridge modules  
- **RL Loop**: Gymnasium + Stable-Baselines3  
- **Surveillance & Vision**: OpenCV, Mediapipe, DeepFace, custom stream handlers  
- **Dashboard & Logs**: Streamlit / Dash + real-time execution visualizers  
- **FinOps**: Real-time market data, dark pool scraping, signal generation  
- **Security**: Cloaked execution, stealth layer, intrusion detection

## SYSTEM PURPOSE

GremlinGPT was engineered to:
- **Write and refactor its own code autonomously**
- **Build systems, mutate itself, and deploy modules on demand**
- **Run self-scheduled task chains (with retry, rollback, escalation)**
- **Learn new functionality via embedded memory loop feedback**
- **Sense system environment and adapt to failures**
- **Persist long-term knowledge via vector embeddings**
- **Grow smarter over time through trial, error, and quantum noise**
